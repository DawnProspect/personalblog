So far i learn a lot of different data types, they are mostly from odin-project and google documentation where i try to understand them. In order to understand it more (making sure i understand it) i will make this article but in my own words, in a sense that if i can explain it by myself then atleast i understand half of it, but this article will also set as a reminder for me in case i need to study it again.
