# Hello! This is my first post blog (using h1 header)

Made this post to test if the blog is working or not, atleast all the words here are showing up.

- This is _italic_
- This is **Bold**
- This is `monospace`

Testing Block Quotes Below:

> There you go.

## This is a h2 header (Going to test this too)

Testing numbered list:
1. Number one
2. Number two
3. Number three

Testing code sample

    # Loop code FOR
    for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        console.log(i);
    }

I can also use delimited blocks as well

This is using delimited blocks
```
# Loop code FOR
for (let i; i < 10; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
```
